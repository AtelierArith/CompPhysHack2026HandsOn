# Description

This website provides lecture materials for participants of [CompPhysHack 2026](https://qc-hybrid.github.io/CompPhysHack2026/).

## Introduction

With advances in artificial intelligence and large language models, coding agents have emerged. These agents autonomously generate source code and execute commands based on human instructions, providing support for coding and software development. This lecture introduces coding agents such as Claude Code and Cursor, and teaches how to leverage them through several hands-on exercises.
